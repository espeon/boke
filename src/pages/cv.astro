        Helping build live video for the AT Protocol â€” aiming to solve video,
        once and for all, for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rebuilt and reworked core surfaces like the homepage, the primary video
        player, and the live chat experience. Played an integral part in moving
        those services to the open-source component library so we can dogfood
        more effectively.

        Built the first version of the Streamplace Docs, using Astro Starlight
        to make documentation easier to understand and maintain.
